And thought that this type of one might work as well
http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/bundle.html 
I thought we could cluster countries by region along the edge of the circle

Variables to work with are 
- location, WHO region and possibly country
- pathogen
- type of research (vaccines, lab methods/diagnostics, therapeutics)
- type of actor (funders, people who run drug trials, basic researchers)
- network connections would be binary and indicate actors that match on pathogen AND research topic (see use cases below).

Use cases
Funder perspective, looking for people to fund: What institutions in this region/country are doing work on this research topic for this pathogen?
Researcher perspective 1 (same as funder perspective), looking for collaborators: What institutions in this region/country are funding work on this research topic for this pathogen?
Researcher perspective 2, looking for funders to give money: What funders in this region/country are funding work on this research topic for this pathogen?
Data
It will be like the spreadsheet I sent last week. They will be sending me an updated version (including type of research) overnight.
Meeting details
with the "big boys" who can make funding and implementation decisions
goals are to show 1) how exciting this is 2) that a solution is already in development to stop other efforts to do something similar.
Get approval to take this prototype and develop it into a bigger system
